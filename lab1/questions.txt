Step 3: Run the program by typing ./ExecutableName and take a note of your observation.
	Observation: When I ran the program, there was segmentation fault 
	

Step 4: Re-run the program by typing ./ExecutableName  3000. Note that the delay in the loop depends on 
	the command line argument you give, here the delay is 3000 microseconds.  
		a.   Enter delays of 500 and 5000, what happens?.


	Observation(s): When I typed 3000 to represent the delay in the loop. After doing that, both the child process and parents process iterated 100 times. Each iteration portrayed a number,
			and went from 0-99. 
		
			a. When I typed 500, the child process prints out 13 and 14, before the parents process is able to print 13. The delay here is a lot faster then 3000 and 5000  
			When I typed 5000, the child process prints out 11 and 12, before the parents process is able to print 12. 5000 has the longest delay, but still outputs the values quickly.
